# 2D-Lattice-Boltzmann-solver

A Simple 2D Implementation of Lattice Boltzmann Method in Python. Allows the user to simulate the flow over a cylinder, array of squares or a rectangular obstacle. 
Top and bottom boundaries can be modelled as walls or periodic. The code was written for educational purposes as a basic introduction to the LBM models. The next step would be to write the code in order to parallelise the calculation and include turbulent LES models.
